      \vspace{2mm}
        As part of the SCD Graduate Scheme I have completed one six month placement in DCIG (Distributed Computing Infrastructure Group) working for UKRI on the infrastructure portal, one six month placement in the Dynamic Infrastructure Group working on DAaaS (Data Analysis as a Service), and 2 months in DAFNI (Data \& Analytics For National Infrastructure). Over these placements I have gained experience in the following (Any referenced \textit{projects} will be mentioned in the Project section further on):
        \begin{center}
        \hdashline
        \end{center}
        \resumeItem{AGILE methodologies, scrum & sprints}
		  {I was part time scrum master while working on DAaaS and currently work in an AGILE environment in DAFNI.}
        \resumeItem{RESTful APIs}
		  {DAFNI is built as Django Micro-services which use REST APIs to interact with each other. The \textit{notification service} I developed is one such service.}
        \resumeItem{Unit Testing}
		  {As the DAFNI Micro-services are constantly evolving, it's important that all new functionality and services are thoroughly unit tested to reduce bugs.}
        \resumeItem{Containerisation}
		  {All DAFNI application are deployed on a Kubenetes to allow this, everything must be containerised in docker containers.}
        \resumeItem{Automated Unit Tests,  CI & CD}
		  {All DAFNI applications are automatically unit tested, built, then deployed as part of their Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipeline. So I gained experience configuring this for the \textit{notification service}.}
        \resumeItem{Package Management}
		  {All DAaaS infrastructure systems can be installed as RPM packages, I packaged both the \textit{Archive Replication service} and the \textit{RB Manager} when developing them. I also created the RPM template repo DAaaS currently use for packaging new applications.}
        \resumeItem{Systemd services}
		  {I developed both the \textit{Archive Replication Service} and the \textit{RB Manager} to be run as system.d services.}
        \resumeItem{Linux Systems}
		  {While working on the \textit{infrastructure portal} and DAaaS, I gained familiarity with SL7 and Centos 7 linux distributions.}
        \resumeItem{Web design}
		  {While working on infrastructure portal I designed almost all of the UI.}
        \resumeItem{Configuration Management}
		  {The \textit{infrastructure portal}'s web front end is configuration managed by Aquilon configuration management, and I gained experience writing and using Ansible configuration management while working in DAaaS.}
		\resumeItem{Working in a Production Environment}
          {DAaaS was operating in production while I was there and I was involved in the day to day monitoring and maintaining of services.}

        For my year in industry I worked in the Software Development department in the Ashfield Healthcare Head Office. As it was a small team, the projects I worked on were quite varied. The following is a list of the most notable experience. (Any referenced \textit{projects} will be mentioned in the Project section further on)
        \begin{center}
        \hdashline
        \end{center}
		\resumeItem{Web Development}
		  {I worked extensively on several in-house applications written in ASP.Net doing general bug fixing to reduce user issues, making requested changes, and deploying web apps to Microsoft servers.}
		\resumeItem{Client Interaction}
		  {During projects I managed, I regularly contacted and met clients to discuss what progress has been made, any roadblocks, and possible improvements to the implementation of their requested changes.}
		\resumeItem{Presenting in Meetings}
		  {A big part of these client meetings was being able to show and articulate what had been achieved. As some of the clients weren't of a technical background, it was paramount to their understanding that I presented what had been done in a clear, concise, and relate-able way.}
		\resumeItem{User Documentation}
		  {To help the users learn how to use \textit{ACAT} I wrote extensive documentation on all the features, with some handy tips and a couple of example workflows.}
		\resumeItem{Lead Developer}
		  {I was the lead developer for \textit{ACAT}, and took all the responsibility that entailed. This included: bug fixing, managing changes, collecting user feedback, and training new users or developers on it.}
		\resumeItem{User Support}
		  {Part of my daily duty involved responding to and resolving tickets about our applications in our help desk system, I was also always logged into a telephone queue ready to receive calls from users experiencing software issues.}

    \resumeSubItem{DAFNI Notification Service}
      {This Django application handles notifying and emailing users asynchronously using rabbitMQ and py-autoqueue}
    \resumeSubItem{py-autoqueue}
      {This is a queue consuming application written in python that takes messages off a rabbitMQ queue and posts them to a worker web app. It's designed to be run as a separate sidecar pod in a container with the worker.}
    \resumeSubItem{NoVNC In browser copy \& paste}
      {Building on top of the noVNC javascript VNC client library, I created an interface that allowed the intuitive copying and pasting of text into the browser window, onto the virtual machine you're connected to.}
    \resumeSubItem{ISIS Archive Replication Service}
      {Developed in python to run as a system.d service, this application mounts remote machines that contain scientific instrument data, then copies it to high availability, higher bandwidth storage}
    \resumeSubItem{RB Manager - data folder management service}
      {This is an application that was developed in python to run as a system.d service, that created, managed and applied ACL permissions to folders.}
    \resumeSubItem{Infrastructure Portal - https://infraportal.org.uk }
      {This Portal is built using Drupal CMS and is a fully search-able database containing details of accessible publicly funded RIIs both in the UK and overseas. The main objective for the portal is to allow people to discover UK-accessible capabilities and expertise within the research and innovation infrastructure system.}
    \resumeSubItem{ACAT - Ashfield Core Admin Tool}
      {This was a windows desktop administration tool I designed, built, and continuously expanded and improved to automate fixes for most of the common help desk tickets. Widely adopted by several departments once they saw the potential time that could be saved by using it.}
    \resumeSubItem{Online Questionnaire and Test tool }
      {For my dissertation Project, which I'm in the process of writing, I am creating an online questionnaire tool that also allows for marked quizzes.}
    \resumeSubItem{Chat Bot}
      {In my spare time I've created a chat bot for a discord group I belong to that can be controlled through a series of custom commands. Discord is very similar to slack, just more for general consumer use.}
